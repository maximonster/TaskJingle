# TaskJingle
Plays jingle when you finish a slayer task and when you level up
Custom jingles can be used by specifying a filepath or link to a MP3 **file**(the path or link has to end in .MP3) of your choice
You can test if you custom jingle works using !testjingle for slayertasks and !testlvljingle for level ups
